## What is this Project?

This is a collection of playful python projects for new learners, emerging developers can leverage these projects in enhancing their skill set while simultaneoulsy learning new things. All the code is properly documented with source and references attached.

## How to Run the Project?
To run the project, please follow these steps:

1. Visit the project's [repository homepage](https://github.com/Yashwanth-Kumar-Kurakula/Python-Playground).

2. Click on the green "<> Code" button, then navigate to the "Local" tab and download the ZIP file.

3. Unpack the downloaded ZIP file.

4. If you haven't already, install Python by visiting the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and following the installation instructions for your operating system.

5. Install the required libraries using "pip", which is typically included with Python. 
    For eg: If you want to install the library "pyautogui" then run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
python3 -m pip install pyautogui
```

6. Navigate to the folder of the program you want to execute and run it either in command line or by using any code editor of your preference.

2. Clone your fork to your local machine using the following command:

    ```sh
    # make sure that git is installed before doing this
    git clone https://github.com/Yashwanth-Kumar-Kurakula/Python-Playground.git
    ```

3. Create a new branch that describes your contribution by entering:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b my-branch
    ```

4. Make your desired changes.

> Important: Please add your GitHub username to the "CONTRIBUTORS.md" file following the creator's syntax.

5. Stage the files you have modified:

    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

6. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

    ```sh
    git commit -m "change... and add..."
    ```

7. Push your changes to your GitHub repository:

    ```sh
    git push -u origin my-branch
    ```

8. Create a pull request by visiting your project fork's page and clicking on "Contribute > Open pull request." You'll be able to provide detailed information about the changes you've made.

9. Wait for your changes to be reviewed and validated. :blush:

## Having Problems?

If you're using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), you might run into an issue where your code is running in the wrong place and can't find the files it needs to work correctly. If this sounds familiar, here's a simple solution:

1. Go to "User Settings" in VSCode.

2. Use the search bar to find "python.terminal.executeInFileDir."

3. Change its value from "false" to "true" by replacing (=).

This adjustment ensures that your Python code runs in the same directory as your files, making everything work smoothly! ðŸ˜Š
