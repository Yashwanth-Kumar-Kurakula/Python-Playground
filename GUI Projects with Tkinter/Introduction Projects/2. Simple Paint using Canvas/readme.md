# Simple Paint using Canvas

This simple Python code demonstrates a basic canvas drawing app using the Tkinter library. The app allows you to draw ovals on a canvas by clicking and dragging the mouse. You can also adjust the brush size using the mouse wheel.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. The canvas window will appear.
3. Click and drag the mouse on the canvas to draw ovals.
4. Use the mouse wheel to adjust the brush size.

## Code Explanation

- The script uses the Tkinter library to create a window and a canvas.
- The `draw_on_canvas` function is called when the left mouse button is dragged, creating ovals at the cursor position.
- The `brush_size_adjust` function adjusts the brush size based on mouse wheel movement.
- The canvas events are bound to their respective functions.
- Initial brush size is set to 2 and can be adjusted up to 50.
